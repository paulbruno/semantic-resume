    summary: >
      Senior FE engineer, developing features, fixes and architectural initiatives for key 
      brands of Fortune 500 cosmetics conglomerate (Estee Lauder and its subsidiaries — MAC
      Cosmetics, Aveda, etc.).
    highlights:
    - >
      Key FE engineer in several site redesign/-build projects (Aveda, Bobbi Brown, Origins, etc.);
      benefits were twofold: multi-million dollar projects would drive multiples of that in revenue
      (via the engagment with the new designs, better IA/UX and marketing push to the renewed
      sites) and retrofitting these sites with better content management tools enabled greater
      internal efficiency for the client, as they self-managed non-mission-critical details of the
      sites' look-and-feel and product content/copy.
    - >
      Served as co-team lead for the EMEA group, then later as the LATAM team lead, managing
      varied teams of the client's FT engineers (EMEA group, UK-based) and our own engineers
      (LATAM group, Argentina-based). Lead both groups in new site builds, region-specific feature
      development (e.g., new payment provider implementation for Mexico), code reviews and
      mentorship through both tenures.
    - >
      Served as front-end engineering anchor for "white label" project, enabling the quicker
      building of new sites and redesigned/-built sites with a generic starting point to be cloned
      from, with an appropriate amt. of features most commonly needed for these sites, implemented
      carefully.
    - >
      Key engineer for client's "single-page checkout" project, rebuilding our standard
      checkout views, flows and logic into a pluggable checkout application, replete with "single
      source of truth" state management, backend-seated logic and responsive front-end with modern
      (for its time) view markup and styling (standard "units"/composable pieces for atomic
      elements of the checkout forms) — in 2013–2014, well before widespread adoption of SPA
      frameworks like React, Angular, et al.
